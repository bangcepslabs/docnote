  host apps can show unsaved-change indicators for upstream editor surfaces.
* Bridged conservative upstream editor dirty events from Web and desktop
  full-editor hosts through injected input, keyboard, paste, drop, and
  toolbar-like click listeners.

  unsaved-change guards and dirty mode-switch handoff.
* Documented full/Web editor dirty APIs and the conservative nature of the
  upstream editor event bridge.
* Added `RhwpExportIntent` so host apps can distinguish Save, Save As, and
  secondary export flows from `RhwpExportedDocument`.
* Split Flutter-native editor file-ribbon Save from Save As HWP/HWPX and made
  Ctrl/Cmd+S preserve the current HWP/HWPX document format.

  when available and to refresh saved source bytes/file names after primary
  HWP/HWPX saves.
* Added example app controller, initial-document injection, and save-file
  injection hooks so file lifecycle behavior can be tested without launching a
  native file dialog.
* Synchronized example Save As HWP/HWPX completions back into rhwp core file
  name metadata and covered the flow with an example widget test.

  same-width mode, and spacing.
* Added rhwp core `getSectionDef`/`setSectionDef` command APIs and a
  Flutter-native section settings dialog for counters, tab spacing, and section
  hide flags.
* Added rhwp core `getPageBorderFill`/`setPageBorderFill` command APIs and a
  Flutter-native Page-ribbon dialog for page border spacing, border line, and
  solid background fill.
* Extended Flutter-native table properties to expose table caption creation,
  removal, direction, alignment, width, and spacing settings.

  properties and the Flutter-native object properties dialog.
* Added selected object rotation and horizontal/vertical flip fields to object
  properties and the Flutter-native object properties dialog.
* Added Flutter-native hyperlink insertion from the input ribbon and
  `RhwpDocument.insertHyperlink(...)`, backed by an rhwp hyperlink field
  command path.
* Added Flutter-native hidden-comment insertion from the input ribbon and
  `RhwpDocument.insertHiddenComment(...)`, backed by an rhwp hidden-comment
  control command path.
* Covered hyperlink/comment insertion with a native editor widget test and an
  Rust facade command smoke test.
* Extended cursor field inspection and `removeFieldAt(...)` so hyperlink field
  markers can be detected and removed while preserving their display text.
* Kept ClickHere property editing scoped to ClickHere fields when the caret is
  inside a non-ClickHere field such as a hyperlink.
* Added `RhwpDocument.updateHyperlink(...)` and a Flutter-native edit hyperlink
  action that updates both the hyperlink URL command and visible display text.
* Added `RhwpDocument.deleteHiddenCommentAt(...)` and a Flutter-native delete
  comment action for removing hidden-comment controls at the body caret.
* Added `RhwpDocument.hiddenCommentAt(...)` and
  `RhwpDocument.updateHiddenCommentAt(...)` with Flutter-native hidden-comment
  editing from the input ribbon and context menu.
* Added `RhwpDocument.insertHyperlinkInTableCell(...)` and
  `RhwpDocument.insertHiddenCommentInTableCell(...)` for active table-cell text
  editing positions.
* Enabled the Flutter-native input ribbon hyperlink/comment buttons when a
  table-cell text caret is active, while keeping them disabled for table block
  selection.
* Covered table-cell hyperlink/comment insertion with Dart command serialization,
  document helper, widget, and Rust facade tests.
* Added `RhwpDocument.hiddenCommentAtInTableCell(...)`,
  `updateHiddenCommentAtInTableCell(...)`, and
  `deleteHiddenCommentAtInTableCell(...)` for hidden-comment lifecycle
  operations inside active table-cell text.
* Enabled Flutter-native hidden-comment edit/delete actions for active
  table-cell text carets and kept them disabled for table block selection.
* Covered table-cell hidden-comment lookup/edit/delete with Dart command
  serialization, document helper, widget, and Rust facade tests.
* Verified active table-cell hyperlink editing through the Flutter-native tools
  ribbon and Rust `updateHyperlink` path for table-cell field locations.

## 2026-06-02 (2026.6.2)

* Added Flutter-native dirty-state reporting with `onDirtyChanged`, including
  clean-state callbacks after successful HWP/HWPX save exports.
* Exposed Flutter-native dirty state through `RhwpEditorController.dirty` and
  `markClean()` for host-driven save/discard flows.
* Added a Flutter-native status-bar modified indicator backed by the shared
  dirty state.
* Added a Flutter-native `onUnsavedChanges` guard before New/Open/Close file
  actions proceed with dirty documents.
* Updated the example save flow so cancelling a desktop save dialog keeps the
  document dirty and cancels pending file actions.
* Started `CHANGELOG.md` date-based sections so future work is grouped by work
  date as well as package version.
* Added `docs/ROADMAP.md` and `docs/TODO.md` to track remaining native-editor,
  fidelity, platform, and release work.
* Added `docs/API_SPEC.md` to map editor toolbar features to public callbacks
  and `RhwpDocument` command APIs.

  page dialog from the native editor chrome.
* Added a Flutter-native status-bar position action for restoring editor focus
  and text input at the current cursor or selection.
* Added a Flutter-native position-field navigation action that moves the native
  editor caret and page viewport from the `Sec`/`Para`/`Offset` fields.
* Added Flutter-native replace-field keyboard handling so Enter applies the
  active replacement and Escape clears/blurs the replace input.
* Covered the Flutter-native Ctrl/Cmd+O file-open shortcut path through the
  same app callback used by the file ribbon.
* Kept Flutter-native editor focus active after the file-ribbon Open action so
  follow-up editor shortcuts can be used without clicking the page again.
* Restored Flutter-native editor focus after save/export callbacks so file
  ribbon exports can be followed by Ctrl/Cmd+S/P without clicking the page.
* Restored Flutter-native editor focus after clearing the search field so
  follow-up editor shortcuts can be used without clicking the page again.
* Restored Flutter-native editor focus after clearing the replace field with
  Escape so follow-up editor shortcuts continue from the document surface.
* Kept Flutter-native search-field focus during live search and repeated
  Enter/Shift+Enter navigation, matching the upstream editor search flow.
* Kept Flutter-native replace-field focus after Enter replaces a match when
  another search match remains, allowing repeated replacements without
  refocusing the field.
* Added a Flutter-native replace-field Ctrl/Cmd+Enter shortcut for Replace all,
  reusing the same command path as the tools-ribbon button.
* Added Flutter-native replace-field Shift+Enter navigation to move to the
  previous search match while keeping replace input focus.
* Guarded Flutter-native search-field Enter handling against duplicate
  `TextField.onSubmitted` delivery so one key press advances only one match.
* Restored Flutter-native replace-field focus policy when duplicate Enter submit
  delivery is skipped after keyboard handling.
* Covered Flutter-native replace-all Ctrl/Cmd+Enter duplicate submit delivery so
  bulk replacement remains single-shot and returns focus to the editor surface.
* Restored Flutter-native editor focus after search toolbar find/previous/next
  actions even when the replace field was active.
* Restored Flutter-native editor focus after clearing search while the replace
  field is active.

  so search counts and highlights follow the edited document state.
* Refreshed Flutter-native search matches after undo/redo snapshot restores so
  search counts and highlights follow restored document content.
* Refreshed Flutter-native search matches after ordinary non-deferred edits so
  search counts and highlights also follow immediate command edits.
* Ignored stale Flutter-native async search results/errors when the search text
  changes before the previous layer-tree search finishes.
* Added Flutter-native active ClickHere field controls that call rhwp core
  active-field APIs and rerender only the current page.
* Added Flutter-native footnote deletion from the insert ribbon using rhwp core
  footnote marker hit detection and delete commands.
* Added Flutter-native footnote text editing from the insert ribbon, backed by
  rhwp core footnote hit/info/insert/delete commands instead of WebView UI.
* Added Flutter-native header/footer manager text editing so a selected
  header/footer item can be edited directly from the manager dialog.
* Added Flutter-native file-ribbon document renaming through `setFileName`, so
  native saves/export metadata can use the updated document name.
* Added Flutter-native page-ribbon controls for clearing existing header and
  footer text through `deleteTextInHeaderFooter`.
* Added Flutter-native selected object HTML clipboard fallback by exporting the
  selected control through `exportControlHtml` during copy and using `pasteHtml`
  when the native object clipboard is unavailable.
* Added Flutter-native body context-menu new-number insertion through the same
  command path as the page ribbon.
* Covered Flutter-native table-cell context-menu ClickHere field property
  editing through the table-cell field inspection command path.
* Added Flutter-native body and table-cell context-menu field actions for
  opening the field list, editing click-here field properties, and removing the
  field at the current cursor.
* Added Flutter-native Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+R/O/L/X shortcuts for inserting rectangle,
  ellipse, line, and text-box shape presets through the native command path.
* Added a Flutter-native Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+I shortcut for inserting a picture
  through the same native command path as the input ribbon.

  decreasing and increasing paragraph indent through the native paragraph
  format command path.
* Added Flutter-native character effect shortcuts for strikethrough,
  superscript, and subscript using the existing native character-format command
  path.
* Added Flutter-native Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Period/Comma shortcuts for increasing
  and decreasing the active editor font size through the same character-format
  command path as the format ribbon.
* Added Flutter-native previous/next page controls to the editor status bar so
  page navigation can be done from the bottom editor chrome without WebView
  controls.
* Added Flutter-native fit-page zoom commands to the view ribbon and status
  bar, computing the zoom from the mounted page and viewport height instead of
  using WebView editor controls.

  page break mode, and repeated header rows.
* Added Flutter-native selected cell properties editing for size, padding,
  vertical alignment, text direction, header, and protection flags.

  bar, matching the upstream editor's dedicated page-width control.
* Added upstream-style Flutter-native font size decrement/increment buttons to
  the format ribbon.
* Added upstream-style Flutter-native paragraph indent decrement/increment
  buttons to the format ribbon.
* Added upstream-style Flutter-native table row above/below and column
  left/right insertion controls to the table ribbon and context menu.

* Added Flutter-native bookmark navigation from the bookmark dialog, backed by
  a new `pageOfPosition` command that resolves a document paragraph to its page
  without creating an edit history entry.
* Kept Flutter-native table-cell text editing active while moving to the next
  or previous cell with Tab and Shift+Tab.
* Localized the Flutter-native bookmark management dialog and covered bookmark
  rename/delete flows from the insert ribbon.
* Isolated Flutter-native typing overlay repaints for pending text, caret, and
  IME composing previews so Space/text input does not repaint the rendered SVG
  page surface.
* Enabled Flutter-native table-cell text context-menu character formatting at
  a collapsed cell caret, so pending format can be applied to the next inserted
  cell text without selecting existing text.
* Covered Flutter-native table-cell context-menu character-shape pending values
  so dialog-based font and style changes are verified before cell text input.
* Added Flutter-native table-cell text context-menu paragraph actions,
  including paragraph shape and direct left/center/right/justify alignment.
* Covered Flutter-native table-cell context-menu paragraph-shape dialog values
  so line spacing, margins, spacing, and indent are verified for active cell

  actions, reusing the document style dialog for paragraph and active cell text
  styling.
* Added Flutter-native body and table-cell text context-menu line-spacing
  preset actions backed by the existing paragraph format command path.
* Added Flutter-native body and table-cell text context-menu paragraph indent
  decrease/increase actions using the shared paragraph format command path.

  selection.
* Added Flutter-native selected table-object movement and deletion through
  rhwp core's dedicated `moveTableOffset` and `deleteTableControl` commands.
* Added rhwp core HTML clipboard bridge commands and wired same-editor
  Flutter-native copy/paste to preserve rich body text and single table-cell
  text through HTML import/export.
* Added Flutter-native table row and column delete actions to the table cell
  context menu.
* Added Flutter-native table cell vertical alignment actions to the table cell
  context menu.

  used them as fallbacks for empty paragraph boundary merging.
* Added Flutter-native left/right arrow paragraph-boundary navigation, including
  empty paragraph fallback through rhwp core paragraph metrics.
* Added Flutter-native word navigation across body paragraph boundaries, so
  Ctrl/Alt+Left and Ctrl/Alt+Right can cross visible and empty paragraphs.
* Added Flutter-native word deletion across body paragraph boundaries, so
  Ctrl/Alt+Backspace and Ctrl/Alt+Delete reuse the same document-aware range
  deletion path.
* Added Flutter-native word deletion while editing table-cell text, including
  multi-paragraph cell ranges through rhwp core's `deleteRangeInTableCell`
  command.
* Added Flutter-native word navigation while editing table-cell text, so
  Ctrl/Alt+Left and Ctrl/Alt+Right move the active cell paragraph offset instead
  of leaking to the body cursor.
* Added Flutter-native Home/End movement while editing table-cell text, including
  a core length fallback for cell paragraphs without visible text runs.
* Added Flutter-native Ctrl/Cmd+Home and Ctrl/Cmd+End movement while editing
  table-cell text, keeping document-boundary shortcuts scoped to the active cell.
* Added Flutter-native PageUp/PageDown movement while editing table-cell text,
  using active-cell page-layer geometry instead of moving the body cursor.
* Added Flutter-native Left/Right movement while editing table-cell text, so
  plain arrow keys update the active cell text offset and cross cell paragraphs
  instead of moving the rectangular cell selection.
* Added Flutter-native Shift+arrow text range selection state and overlay while
  editing table-cell text, starting with horizontal caret extension.
* Wired Flutter-native table-cell text selections into editing commands, so
  Backspace/Delete remove the selected cell text and typed input replaces it.
* Wired Flutter-native table-cell text selections into copy/cut and rich HTML
  clipboard export, so only the selected cell text range is copied or removed.
* Wired Flutter-native table-cell text selections into paste, including rich
  HTML replacement and multiline plain-text paste through cell paragraph split.
* Changed multiline Flutter-native table-cell paste to show the first inserted
  line, pending deletion mask, and final cell caret immediately while slow Rust
  cell insert/split commands are still pending.
* Changed Flutter-native body and table-cell text cut to show pending deletion
  masks and collapsed caret positions before slow Rust delete commands finish.
* Changed multi-paragraph Flutter-native table-cell text cut and paste
  replacement previews to split pending deletion masks per cell paragraph.
* Changed multi-paragraph Flutter-native table-cell keyboard delete previews to
  split pending deletion masks per cell paragraph before Rust range deletion
  commands finish.
* Added Flutter-native select-all behavior while editing table-cell text, so
  `Ctrl+A`/`Cmd+A` selects the active cell's internal text instead of body text.
* Changed Flutter-native table-cell search results and replacements to use the
  active cell text selection model, matching body search selection behavior.
* Added Flutter-native double-click word selection while editing table-cell
  text, using the same page-layer word-boundary logic as body text selection.
* Added Flutter-native triple-click paragraph selection while editing table-cell
  text, scoped to the active cell paragraph.
* Added Flutter-native drag selection while editing table-cell text, keeping
  text drags scoped to the active cell instead of rectangular cell selection.
* Changed Flutter-native Shift+click in active table-cell text editing to extend
  the cell text range instead of switching to rectangular cell selection.
* Kept Flutter-native table-cell text selections intact when secondary-clicking
  inside the selected cell text range, so context-menu actions operate on the
  existing selection.
* Added Flutter-native character formatting for selected table-cell text ranges,
  including context-menu formatting actions while cell text is selected.
* Kept Flutter-native editor focus after character-format toolbar actions, so
  follow-up shortcuts continue to apply to the current editor selection.
* Compacted the Flutter-native format toolbar by moving text colors and advanced
  effects into popup menus, and reset document click sequencing after toolbar
  actions so follow-up page taps do not become accidental double-clicks.
* Applied Flutter-native paragraph formatting to every table-cell paragraph
  covered by a selected cell text range, instead of only the active cell
  paragraph.
* Applied Flutter-native document styles to every table-cell paragraph covered
  by a selected cell text range, and refreshed the current paragraph-format
  state after style application.
* Added Flutter-native Up/Down movement while editing table-cell text, using
  page-layer text geometry first and core cell-paragraph metrics as a fallback
  instead of moving the rectangular cell selection.
* Limited deferred Flutter-native text-input refreshes to the edited page, so
  large documents do not re-render every mounted page when optimistic typing
  finally synchronizes with fresh SVG.
* Anchored Flutter-native pending text previews to table-cell text source
  context, so optimistic table-cell input overlays do not snap to body text runs
  that share the same section and paragraph identifiers.
* Anchored Flutter-native pending deletion masks to table-cell text source
  context for selected, overwrite, character, and word deletion in active cell
  text editing.
* Anchored Flutter-native table-cell text carets and IME composing previews to
  table-cell text source context instead of the body selection caret.
* Stabilized programmatic viewer page navigation so `goToPage` requests are not
  immediately overwritten by stale visible-page sync during editor navigation.
* Added Flutter-native Delete-at-cell-paragraph-end handling to merge the next
  table-cell paragraph.
* Added Flutter-native bookmark list/add/delete/rename commands and an input
  ribbon bookmark dialog backed by rhwp core's bookmark API.
* Added Flutter-native field list/value commands and a tools-ribbon field value
  dialog backed by rhwp core's field API.
* Added Flutter-native cursor field inspection, ClickHere field property
  editing, and field-marker removal through rhwp core's field APIs.
* Added Flutter-native load-time `convertToEditable` support so distribution
  HWP documents follow the upstream Web editor's editable-load path by default.
* Added Flutter-native page hide commands and a page-ribbon dialog backed by
  rhwp core's PageHide API.
* Added Flutter-native header/footer list and delete commands from the page
  ribbon, backed by rhwp core's header/footer control APIs.
* Added the upstream-style F6 shortcut to open the Flutter-native style picker.
* Added the upstream-style `Alt+T` shortcut to open the Flutter-native paragraph
  shape dialog.
* Matched the upstream page setup shortcut by opening the Flutter-native page
  setup dialog with F7.
* Added a Flutter-native replace shortcut so Ctrl/Cmd+H opens the tools ribbon
  and focuses the replace field without invoking the WebView editor.
* Added `holdTextRefreshWhileFocused` for the Flutter-native editor and enabled
  it in the example app so desktop Space/text input does not release a page SVG
  refresh until focus moves outside the editor.
* Made focused text refresh holding the default for `RhwpNativeEditor`,
  `RhwpEditor`, and `RhwpCommandEditor`, with focus-loss release handling for
  delayed desktop text-input actions.
* Stabilized desktop text-input focus churn handling so connection-close,
  delayed action, transient focus loss, and explicit external focus transitions
  release or hold native-editor page refresh at the right time.
* Kept `holdTextRefreshWhileFocused` from treating transient desktop text-input
  focus churn as an external focus move, preventing per-key page refreshes in the
  example app.
* Delayed external-focus-triggered refresh release while desktop text input is
  still settling, so Space/text commits do not refresh the example document
  between keystrokes on macOS/Linux/Windows.
* Kept desktop text-input `null` focus churn from releasing focused native-editor
  page refresh; deferred refresh now waits for an actual external focus target.
* Kept desktop text-input connections from being treated as completed external
  focus moves while pending native-editor text overlays are still visible.
* Added Flutter-native file shortcuts for Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+S HWPX save and
  Ctrl/Cmd+P PDF export alongside the existing Ctrl/Cmd+S HWP save.
* Changed Flutter-native character toolbar and shortcuts to toggle active
  Bold/Italic/Underline/Strike/script/emboss states instead of only forcing
  them on.
* Added Flutter-native paragraph-boundary merge behavior for Backspace at the
  start of a paragraph and Delete at the end of a paragraph.
* Kept first/last paragraph boundary Backspace/Delete no-ops from triggering a
  native-editor page refresh.
* Added a Flutter-native go-to-page dialog from the view ribbon and Ctrl/Cmd+G,
  backed by the existing `RhwpViewerController.goToPage` page scroller.
* Kept Flutter-native IME composing previews and page overlays on their own
  listenable/repaint layers so Space/text input does not rebuild or repaint the
  rendered HWP page surface.
* Kept cached SVG page widgets alive across desktop text-input dependency churn
  so Space/text commits do not recreate the rendered page surface.
* Added Flutter-native zoom preset menus to the view ribbon and status bar,
  matching the upstream web editor's direct percentage selection.
* Matched Flutter-native viewer/editor zoom controls to the upstream web editor
  preset steps from 25% through 300%.
* Tracked the visible page while scrolling `RhwpViewer` and surfaced that page
  in the Flutter-native editor status bar.
* Kept focused Flutter-native text input from releasing deferred page refresh
  after `TextInputAction.done`, so Space/text commits stay in the overlay until
  the editor actually loses focus.
* Changed the Flutter-native character shape dialog to preload the current
  caret character's font, style toggles, and colors.
* Changed the Flutter-native paragraph shape dialog to preload the current
  caret paragraph's alignment, line spacing, indents, and margins.
* Added paragraph-property query commands and synchronized the Flutter-native
  format ribbon with the caret's current paragraph alignment and line spacing.
* Treated external primary-focus churn during a desktop text commit as part of
  the active native-editor input session, preventing Space/text input from
  immediately releasing deferred page refresh.
* Added Flutter-native selected object copy, cut, and paste through rhwp core's
  internal control clipboard.
* Kept Flutter-native editor text refresh blocked when desktop focus/action
  churn arrives before a slow input command finishes.
* Debounced desktop text-input focus churn with the native editor refresh delay
  so typing or Space does not trigger visible page refreshes between commits.
* Restored the Flutter-native editor TextInput focus after delayed desktop
  input churn so typing or Space does not reopen a page refresh while editing.
* Kept late desktop text input actions from flushing an already scheduled
  native-editor page refresh while optimistic text input is still active.
* Added Flutter-native new page number insertion from the page ribbon through
  rhwp core's `insert_new_number_native` command.
* Added Flutter-native header/footer text insertion from the page ribbon,
  backed by rhwp core header/footer query and text-edit commands.
* Changed the Flutter-native header/footer text dialog to prefill existing
  text and replace it through the Rust header/footer delete command.
* Added Flutter-native style list/apply commands and a format toolbar style
  picker for body paragraphs and selected table-cell paragraphs.
* Added Flutter-native character background/shade color formatting for selected
  text, table-cell text, pending input, and the character-shape dialog.
* Added Flutter-native superscript/subscript character formatting from the
  format ribbon, pending input, and character-shape dialog.
* Added Flutter-native emboss/engrave character formatting from the format
  ribbon, pending input, and character-shape dialog.
* Added a Flutter-native view-ribbon toggle that overlays transparent table cell
  borders from the page layer tree.
* Added the upstream-style `Alt+L` shortcut to open the Flutter-native character
  shape dialog.
* Changed the Flutter-native caret overlay to blink on the same 500ms cadence as
  the upstream web editor while keeping the caret hit-test widget mounted.
* Treated root or ancestor focus churn during desktop text input as part of the
  active editor session so Space/text input does not release deferred refresh.
* Matched upstream table-cell edit mode handling so `F5` enters a selected cell
  and `Esc` returns active cell text editing to cell selection.
* Matched upstream search-field keyboard handling so `Enter`/`Shift+Enter`
  navigate matches and `Esc` clears the active search from the tools ribbon.
* Matched upstream find shortcut behavior so `Ctrl/Cmd+F` selects the existing
  search text when focusing the tools-ribbon search field.
* Added upstream-style debounced live search from the Flutter-native tools
  ribbon search field.
* Scoped `RhwpViewer` controller rebuilds to zoom changes so native-editor
  cursor updates during typing do not refresh the page surface.
* Batched continuous Flutter-native text input into one undo snapshot so Space
  and character input avoid repeated full-document snapshot work.
* Added Flutter-native font family selection to the format ribbon and character
  shape dialog, backed by rhwp font id registration and char-layout reflow
  through the Rust facade.
* Added native char-property query commands and synchronized the Flutter-native
  format ribbon with the caret's current document character shape.
* Added upstream-style line-spacing presets to the Flutter-native format ribbon.
* Kept Flutter-native editor deferred page refresh blocked when desktop text
  input focus briefly drops and returns during typing.
* Initial flutter_rhwp plugin scaffold.
* Added flutter_rust_bridge v2 Rust bridge with vendored rhwp v0.7.12.
* Added Dart APIs for opening bytes, rendering SVG, extracting text/Markdown,
  exporting HWP/HWPX/PDF, and applying basic text commands.
* Added RhwpViewer, an initial RhwpEditor overlay, and an example app with
  open/save/export workflows.
* Added facade tests against the vendored blank HWP sample, DOCX package
  output, and explicit unsupported exceptions for Web/WASM PDF export.
* Added HWP/HWPX export reopen checks for both the vendored blank sample and
  the bundled example asset.
* Strengthened native PDF export tests with structural PDF checks and a fast
  multi-page SVG-to-PDF regression case.
* Verified the FRB Web/WASM build path and patched vendored rhwp's standalone
  WASM startup and web-sys canvas style compatibility for FRB integration.
* Updated package metadata links for `JAICHANGPARK/flutter_rhwp`.
* Added a bundled example HWP asset and wired the example app to open it by
  default while keeping file picker and export/save workflows.
* Added text, Markdown, and SVG to the public Dart export surface and example
  export menu.
* Implemented initial DOCX export as a valid Word OOXML package generated from
  extracted document text, and exposed it in the example export menu.
* Added a Web-only `RhwpWebEditor` embed for upstream `@rhwp/editor`, plus an
  example app toggle between the Flutter bridge editor and the upstream Web
  editor.
* Added `RhwpWebEditorController` so Web editor mode can export bytes from the
  upstream editor state instead of the stale Flutter bridge document.
* Added a Web COOP/COEP service worker bootstrap for local FRB WASM debugging.
* Use the FRB process loader on iOS/macOS so the statically linked Rust library
  can be resolved inside Flutter apps.
* Removed incomplete Apple SwiftPM manifests so iOS/macOS builds use the
  CocoaPods podspec/cargokit path that links the Rust static library.
* Added Linux desktop example integration tests for opening the bundled HWP
  asset, rendering SVG, extracting text/Markdown, and exporting supported
  formats.
* Run Linux desktop integration tests under Xvfb in CI for headless GitHub
  Actions runners.
* Added macOS desktop example integration tests to CI for the bundled asset
  open/render/export workflow.
* Added Windows desktop example integration tests to CI for the bundled asset
  open/render/export workflow.
* Added Android emulator example integration tests to CI for the bundled asset
  open/render/export workflow.
* Added GitHub Actions CI for Rust/Dart checks, Web WASM build, desktop builds,
  and Android/iOS example builds.
* Added a custom `RhwpViewer` SVG builder hook and Flutter widget paint tests
  for viewer rendering, zoom, and editor overlay command flows.
* Isolated rendered SVG pages behind a repaint boundary so native editor typing
  overlays do not force the HWP page raster layer to repaint.
* Added a `RhwpViewer` page virtualization regression test for lazy SVG page
  rendering during scroll.
* Added a Flutter-drawn `RhwpEditor` command-target caret and selection marker
  with widget coverage for collapsed and expanded selection states.
* Changed the example Web app to default to upstream Web editor mode so HWP
  open/edit/export can run without eager FRB WASM initialization on startup.
* Added example Web widget tests to CI so the browser editor mode shell is
  verified before the FRB WASM build.
* Added an iOS simulator CI helper and mobile workflow step for the example
  bundled asset open/render/export integration test.
* Added a generated FRB bridge mock smoke test for the Dart Rust API entrypoint.
* Improved DOCX export to use extracted Markdown and emit heading and simple
  table OOXML instead of only plain paragraph runs.
* Added root third-party notices for the vendored rhwp core, Cargokit, direct
  Dart/Rust dependencies, and generated FRB bridge files.
* Added a Web widget smoke test for bundled sample auto-open in upstream Web
  editor mode without eager Flutter bridge WASM initialization, and made empty
  Web editor module URLs render an inline message without injecting a bootstrap
  script.
* Added a typed Dart page layer tree model on top of rhwp's raw page layer tree
  JSON so editor/viewer code can inspect text nodes and bounds without ad hoc
  JSON traversal.
* Added text-run geometry helpers for page layer trees and made `RhwpEditor`
  prefer layer-tree caret/selection bounds when first-page text run geometry is
  available.
* Added a page-local `RhwpViewer.pageOverlayBuilder` hook and moved
  `RhwpEditor` caret/selection painting onto each rendered page so visible page
  overlays stay aligned with viewer scrolling and page layout.
* Added a Flutter-native page setup dialog that reads and updates rhwp page
  definitions through the Rust bridge.
* Added Flutter-native footnote insertion from the insert ribbon through the
  Rust command bridge.
* Added Flutter-native equation insertion from the insert ribbon through the
  Rust command bridge.
* Prevented immediate text input actions from flushing the Flutter-native
  editor's deferred page refresh after every committed character.
* Reduced example-app typing refresh churn by using a longer native-editor
  render sync delay and deferring HWP snapshot export until save/export or a
  native-to-full-editor mode switch.
* Added Flutter-native picture insertion from the insert ribbon through an app
  supplied image picker callback and the Rust command bridge.
* Added Flutter-native rectangle shape insertion from the insert ribbon through
  the Rust shape-control command bridge.
* Expanded Flutter-native shape insertion into a preset menu for rectangle,
  ellipse, line, and text box controls.
* Added a `moveLineEndpoint` Dart/Rust command and Flutter-native line endpoint
  drag handles for selected line objects.
* Added Flutter-native page break and column break insertion from the insert
  ribbon and Ctrl/Cmd+Enter shortcuts through the Rust command bridge.
* Added a Flutter-native document information dialog from the file ribbon,
  backed by the existing Rust document metadata bridge.
* Extended page layer tree selection geometry to span multiple paragraphs and
  wired `RhwpEditor` page overlays to render those page-local selection rects.
* Added a Rust facade regression test for the page layer tree JSON contract that
  Flutter editor geometry depends on.
* Added `RhwpExportedDocument` and `RhwpDocument.exportDocument()` so save and
  download flows can use the same bytes, file name, extension, and MIME
  metadata contract across the Flutter bridge and example app.
* Added `RhwpWebEditorController.exportDocument()` so upstream Web editor mode
  can use the same export artifact metadata contract as the Flutter bridge.
* Documented the Rust vendoring policy: commit `rust/vendor/rhwp` for
  reproducible builds, but keep generated `rust/target` output ignored.
* Verified that the example Web release build completes after the Web editor
  default-mode and export artifact changes.
* Added Dart API documentation for export artifact metadata and Web editor
  controller export methods.
* Relaxed the `flutter_rust_bridge` dependency constraint to a caret range and
  recorded the current `flutter pub publish --dry-run` warnings.
* Added `.pubignore` so repository work logs remain in `docs/` without being
  published in the runtime package archive.
* Added bundled asset integration coverage for native PDF export metadata and
  PDF byte structure, while keeping Web/WASM on the explicit unsupported path.
* Added `RhwpFullEditor` as the public full-editor surface backed by upstream
  `@rhwp/editor`, and introduced `RhwpCommandEditor` to make the Flutter-native
  command overlay's limited role explicit.
* Backed native `RhwpFullEditor` with `webview_all` so the upstream editor can
  be hosted on Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux instead of being limited
  to Web.
* Updated the Linux example runner to host Flutter in a `GtkOverlay`, matching
  the platform view setup required by `webview_all`'s Linux WebKitGTK
  implementation.
* Added the WebKitGTK 4.1 development package to Linux CI dependencies for the
  full-editor WebView host.
* Raised the Flutter SDK lower bound to 3.35.0 to match the native full-editor
  WebView host dependency.
* Added macOS outgoing network entitlements to the example app so WKWebView can
  load the upstream editor module in sandboxed debug/profile/release runs.
* Added a Flutter-side loading/error overlay for native `RhwpFullEditor` so
  WebView bootstrap failures do not appear as a blank black panel.
* Fixed upstream editor file injection by using `@rhwp/editor`'s documented
  `loadFile(data, fileName)` API, and added `getPageSvg()` as the SVG export
  method for full-editor mode.
* Simplified README around package purpose, installation, quick start, usage,
  example, notes, and license.
* Added ArrowUp/ArrowDown paragraph navigation with Shift selection extension
  in the Flutter-native editor.
* Added Tab key text insertion in the Flutter-native editor, including
  replacement of active text selections.
* Changed Flutter-native ArrowUp/ArrowDown movement to prefer page-layer text
  run geometry before falling back to paragraph order.
* Changed Flutter-native Home/End movement to use page-layer line geometry
  before falling back to paragraph boundaries.
* Added Ctrl/Option+Arrow word navigation with Shift selection extension in the
  Flutter-native editor.
* Added Ctrl/Option+Backspace/Delete word deletion in the Flutter-native
  editor.
* Added PageUp/PageDown page-level keyboard navigation with Shift selection
  extension in the Flutter-native editor.
* Added `RhwpNativeEditor` as the 100% Flutter widget editor track while
  keeping `RhwpFullEditor` as the WebView/upstream editor fallback.
* Reworked the Flutter-native editor surface with a Flutter toolbar, menu tabs,
  page viewport, caret/selection overlay, status bar, and basic insert/delete
  command flow.
* Updated the example editor toggle from `Commands` to `Native editor`.
* Added page-layer text hit testing so the Flutter-native editor can move the
  caret by tapping rendered document text.
* Wired Flutter-native drag selection to the same page-layer hit-test model.
* Added Flutter-native editor keyboard handling for left/right/home caret
  movement, shift-selection, and backspace/delete command dispatch.
* Added a Flutter `TextInputClient` bridge so the native editor can receive IME
  text composition and commit finalized text through the Rust insert command.
* Added a Flutter-native composing preview overlay so active IME composition is
  visible near the caret before it is committed to the document.
* Added page-layer selection text extraction plus Flutter-native editor
  copy/cut/paste shortcuts and toolbar actions.
* Added `splitParagraph` to the Rust bridge command surface and wired
  Flutter-native Enter/Shift+Enter handling.
* Added `deleteRange` to the Rust bridge command surface and wired
  Flutter-native multi-paragraph selection replacement.
* Added `applyCharFormat` to the Rust bridge command surface and wired
  Flutter-native bold, italic, and underline toolbar/shortcut actions.
* Added `applyCharFormatRange` for same-section multi-paragraph character
  formatting in the Flutter-native editor.
* Added `applyParaFormat` and `applyParaFormatRange` for paragraph alignment,
  with Flutter-native toolbar buttons for left, center, right, and justify.
* Added Ctrl/Cmd+L/E/R/J paragraph alignment shortcuts for left, center, right,
  and justify in the Flutter-native editor.
* Added `insertTable` to the Rust bridge command surface and wired a
  Flutter-native toolbar table insertion action.
* Added table row/column insert and delete commands to the Rust bridge surface
  with Flutter-native toolbar actions.
* Added table cell merge and split commands to the Rust bridge surface with
  Flutter-native toolbar actions.
* Added page-layer table cell hit testing so `RhwpNativeEditor` can fill table
  edit context from tapped rendered cells.
* Added Flutter-native table cell selection state and page overlay highlighting
  for tapped rendered cells.
* Added drag-based table cell range selection in `RhwpNativeEditor`, including
  multi-cell overlay highlighting and merge command context updates.
* Added Shift+click range extension for selected table cells in the
  Flutter-native editor.
* Added selected table cell text insert/delete commands through the Rust bridge
  and wired `RhwpNativeEditor` text input to the active cell.
* Added table cell text source parsing and hit testing so tapping rendered cell
  text sets the active cell edit offset.
* Added page-layer object/control hit testing and Flutter overlay highlighting
  for selected bounded objects in `RhwpNativeEditor`.
* Added a `deleteObjectControl` Dart/Rust command and wired selected object
  deletion through `RhwpNativeEditor` Delete/Backspace handling and context
  menu actions.
* Added selected object z-order commands to the Dart/Rust bridge and exposed
  bring-to-front/send-to-back/forward/backward actions through the
  Flutter-native edit ribbon and object context menu.
* Added selected object size/position property commands to the Dart/Rust bridge
  and exposed them through a Flutter-native object properties dialog.
* Added Flutter-native pointer drag move and resize handles for selected
  objects, backed by the same object properties bridge command.
* Added Arrow and Shift+Arrow keyboard nudging for selected objects in the
  Flutter-native editor.
* Added Shift+drag aspect-ratio preservation for selected object resize
  handles in the Flutter-native editor.
* Changed Flutter-native document edits to preserve the viewer widget and scroll
  position while refreshing rendered page content.
* Changed page SVG refreshes to keep showing the previous render until the next
  render completes, reducing edit-time flicker in the native editor.
* Changed Flutter-native text input, tab input, paste, and keyboard text delete
  edits to debounce page SVG refreshes so typing does not reload the page on
  every keystroke.
* Added a configurable `editRefreshDelay` for `RhwpNativeEditor` and set the
  example app to a 1200 ms delay so slower typing does not trigger a page SVG
  refresh after every space or character.
* Changed Flutter-native text input refresh scheduling to wait for the active
  text input action or connection close before starting `editRefreshDelay`,
  preventing page SVG refreshes while the user is still typing, and queued
  rapid text input commits so characters are not skipped while a previous edit
  command is still finishing.
* Added an optimistic Flutter text overlay for committed native-editor input so
  newly typed text remains visible until the refreshed page SVG finishes
  rendering, including table cell input and a temporary caret at the end of the
  pending text.
* Changed collapsed body text input to advance the Flutter pending text overlay
  and caret before a slow Rust `insertText` command finishes, so rapid Space and
  text entry stays visible without triggering per-character page SVG refresh.
* Changed active table-cell text input to advance the Flutter pending text
  overlay and cell caret before a slow Rust `insertTextInTableCell` command
  finishes, keeping rapid Space/text entry visible inside the selected cell.
* Changed single-paragraph body selection replacement to show the Flutter
  pending delete mask, replacement text overlay, and collapsed caret before a
  slow Rust `deleteText` command finishes.
* Changed multi-paragraph body selection replacement to show Flutter pending
  delete masks and replacement text before a slow Rust `deleteRange` command
  finishes.
* Changed single-paragraph table-cell text selection replacement to show the
  Flutter pending delete mask, replacement text overlay, and cell caret before a
  slow Rust `deleteTextInTableCell` command finishes.
* Added pending delete masks for Flutter-native body text deletion and
  selection replacement so removed text is hidden until the refreshed page SVG
  finishes rendering.
* Changed Flutter-native text input previews to update through a scoped
  notifier and suppressed root editor rebuilds for pending typing cursor moves,
  reducing visible page refresh while entering spaces or text.
* Added a short desktop text-input focus grace window so transient IME/focus
  churn while typing does not release the deferred page refresh immediately.
* Extended desktop native-editor input hold handling so delayed text input
  actions and longer focus churn after a space or character do not trigger a
  page SVG refresh while typing is still in progress.
* Added Flutter-native Insert/Overwrite input mode toggling with the Insert key,
  including overwrite text replacement through the Rust `deleteText` command.
* Extended Flutter-native overwrite typing to active table cell text through
  the Rust `deleteTextInTableCell` command.
* Changed the Flutter-native status bar to show active table cell row/column
  and object selection context instead of only body paragraph offsets.
* Added a Flutter-native paragraph mark view toggle that paints paragraph-end
  markers from page layer tree text runs without changing rendered document
  output.
* Added a Flutter-native compare dialog in the tools ribbon that uses
  `extractText` and shows same/changed/added/removed line counts without
  editing the document.
* Changed Flutter-native body paste to convert multiline clipboard text into
  paragraph split and insert commands instead of inserting raw newline text.
* Changed multiline Flutter-native body paste to show the first inserted line
  and final logical caret immediately while slow Rust `insertText` and
  `splitParagraph` commands are still pending.
* Added Flutter-native double-click word selection based on page-layer text run
  hit testing.
* Added Flutter-native triple-click paragraph selection using the same
  page-layer text source model.
* Added Flutter-native Shift+click selection extension for rendered text.
* Added Arrow and Tab keyboard navigation for selected table cells in the
  Flutter-native editor, including Shift+Arrow range extension.
* Added Escape handling in the Flutter-native editor to clear composing input,
  selected table cells, selected text, and active search highlights.
* Added Enter handling for selected table cells so the Flutter-native editor
  enters the active cell without dispatching a body paragraph split command.
* Added Flutter-native copy, cut, and paste handling for selected table cell
  text using page-layer cell text runs and table-cell edit commands.
* Added Flutter-native multi-cell table paste so tab/newline clipboard text is
  distributed across rendered table cells instead of being inserted into one
  active cell.
* Added Flutter-native find/replace support for table cell text using
  page-layer cell contexts and table-cell edit commands.
* Changed Delete/Backspace on selected table cells to clear the selected cell
  text, while preserving character-level deletion for active cell text editing.
* Split the Flutter-native editor toolbar into HWP-style ribbon tabs for file,
  edit, view, input, format, page, table, and tools, with table cell selection
  opening the table ribbon context.
* Added a Flutter-native secondary-click context menu for text selection,
  clipboard, formatting, paragraph alignment, table insertion, and selected
  table cell actions.
* Exposed strikethrough, font size, and text color character-format properties
  in the Dart command surface, and added a Flutter-native character shape dialog
  that applies those values through the Rust bridge.
* Added inline Flutter-native font size and text color controls to the format
  ribbon so common character shape edits no longer require opening the dialog.
* Added pending character formatting for collapsed selections in the native
  editor, so toolbar font/shape choices apply to the next inserted body text.
* Exposed line spacing, line spacing type, indent, and paragraph margin
  properties in the Dart paragraph-format command surface, and added a
  Flutter-native paragraph shape dialog that applies those values through the
  Rust bridge.
* Added Flutter-native text search in `RhwpNativeEditor`, using page layer tree
  text runs to select and highlight matches without calling the upstream Web
  editor.
* Added viewer page navigation to `RhwpViewerController`, wired the
  Flutter-native editor view ribbon to previous/next page controls, and made
  search result selection request the matching page.
* Added file-ribbon export actions to `RhwpNativeEditor` so HWP, HWPX, and PDF
  save artifacts can be emitted through a Flutter callback without using the
  upstream Web editor.
* Added synchronized zoom controls to the Flutter-native editor view ribbon and
  status bar, backed by the shared `RhwpEditorController` zoom state.
* Added Ctrl/Cmd zoom shortcuts to the Flutter-native editor for zoom in, zoom
  out, and reset zoom.
* Added Ctrl/Cmd+mouse-wheel zoom handling to the Flutter-native editor
  viewport.
* Added file-open callback support to `RhwpNativeEditor` and wired the example
  app so the native editor file ribbon can launch the same file picker and save
  callbacks as the outer app toolbar.
* Added header/footer creation commands to the Dart/Rust bridge and enabled the
  Flutter-native editor page ribbon Header/Footer buttons.
* Added snapshot commands to the Dart/Rust bridge and wired `RhwpNativeEditor`
  edit-ribbon undo/redo to rhwp core snapshots.
* Added active search-match replace to the Flutter-native editor tools ribbon,
  using undo-aware delete/insert commands through the Rust bridge.
* Added replace-all to the Flutter-native editor tools ribbon, applying all
  current search matches in one undo-aware edit transaction.
* Added Flutter-native select-all through the edit ribbon, context menu, and
  Ctrl/Cmd+A shortcut using page layer tree source positions.
* Added End and Shift+End keyboard navigation to move or extend selection to
  the current paragraph end from page layer tree source positions.
* Added Ctrl/Cmd+F handling in `RhwpNativeEditor` to open the tools ribbon and
  focus the Flutter-native search field.
* Added F3 and Shift+F3 search result navigation shortcuts for the
  Flutter-native editor.
* Added Ctrl/Cmd+Home and Ctrl/Cmd+End document boundary navigation, including
  Shift selection extension, using page layer tree source positions.
* Kept Flutter-native text input refresh deferred while desktop platforms churn
  the text input connection, so typing spaces or characters no longer triggers
  a page SVG refresh while the editor still has focus.
* Kept delayed desktop `TextInputAction.done` events from releasing the
  Flutter-native editor's deferred page refresh while the editor still has
  focus, preventing another per-character refresh path on macOS/Linux/Windows.
* Cached the rendered SVG page widget inside `RhwpViewer` so native-editor
  overlay updates during typing do not rebuild the SVG picture and appear as a
  page refresh.
* Added `applyCharFormatInTableCell` to the Dart/Rust command surface and wired
  Flutter-native character formatting to selected table cell text and pending
  table-cell input.
* Added `applyParaFormatInTableCell` to the Dart/Rust command surface and wired
  Flutter-native paragraph alignment/shape actions to selected table cell
  paragraphs.
* Added `applyTableCellStyle` to the Dart/Rust command surface and wired
  Flutter-native table ribbon actions for selected cell fill and border style.
* Extended `applyTableCellStyle` with selected table cell vertical alignment
  controls in the Flutter-native table ribbon.
